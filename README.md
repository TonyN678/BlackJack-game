# BlackJack-game




I decided to develop the game named BlackJack for its popularity among my friends.



Blackjack is a popular card game that is played at casinos all around the world. Here are the basic rules and instructions on how to play:
Objective: The objective of the game is to have a hand value higher than the dealer's without going over 21.
Card values: The cards 2-10 are worth their face value, face cards (jack, queen, and king) are worth 10, and an ace can be worth 1 or 11.
The dealer deals two cards to each player and one card to themselves, all face-up.
Players take turns deciding whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand value). Players can continue to hit until they decide to stand or their hand value exceeds 21, which results in a "bust" and an automatic loss.
Once all players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals their second card and must hit until their hand value reaches at least 17.
If the dealer busts, all remaining players win. If the dealer does not bust, their hand value is compared to each player's hand value, and the player with the higher hand value wins. In the event of a tie, the hand is a "push" and the player's bet is returned.



This program is still in testing, more upcomming features will be:
There will be currency in this game where player can bet based on their interests.
